            "question": "What is generative AI, and how does it differ from discriminative AI?",
            "answer": "Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new data instances that resemble the training data. It contrasts with discriminative AI, which models the boundary between classes to classify data. For example, a generative model might create new images of faces, while a discriminative model would classify whether an image contains a face."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you explain the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?",
            "answer": "A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity. They are trained simultaneously; the generator improves its ability to produce realistic data, and the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing real from fake data."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some common use cases for generative AI?",
            "answer": "Common use cases include generating realistic images (like DeepFakes), creating art and music, text generation (like chatbots or story writing), enhancing low-resolution images, and drug discovery by generating molecular structures."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you evaluate the performance of a generative model?",
            "answer": "Performance can be evaluated using metrics such as Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), and human judgment. IS assesses how realistic generated images are and how diverse they are, while FID compares the distribution of generated images to real images."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some challenges you face when training generative models?",
            "answer": "Challenges include mode collapse (where the model generates limited varieties of outputs), balancing training between the generator and discriminator, computational resource requirements, and ensuring the quality and diversity of generated outputs."
        },
        {
            "question": "What libraries or frameworks are you familiar with for building generative models?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Can you describe a project where you implemented a generative model?",
            "answer": "In a previous project, I developed a GAN to generate synthetic medical images for training purposes. The model was trained on a dataset of X-ray images, and after tuning, it was able to produce high-quality synthetic images that were indistinguishable from real ones. This helped in augmenting datasets for better model performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you handle ethical considerations in generative AI?",
            "answer": "I prioritize transparency, data privacy, and bias mitigation in generative AI projects. I ensure that the data used for training is ethically sourced and that the generated outputs do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or misinformation."

        {
            "question": "What is the role of latent space in generative models?",
            "answer": "Latent space is a compressed representation of the input data, where similar inputs are mapped to nearby points. It allows generative models to learn the underlying structure of the data and facilitates the generation of new data points by sampling from this space."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you stay updated with the latest developments in generative AI?",
            "answer": "I regularly read research papers on platforms like arXiv, follow industry leaders and AI research labs on social media, and participate in online courses and workshops. I also engage with the AI community through forums and conferences to exchange knowledge and ideas."

        },
        {
            "question": "How would you handle a deployment failure in a CI/CD pipeline?",
            "answer": "I would first analyze the logs and metrics to identify the cause of the failure. If it’s a code issue, I would roll back to the previous stable version. If it’s an infrastructure issue, I would fix the underlying problems and redeploy. Additionally, I would implement better monitoring and alerting to catch similar issues earlier in the future."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the difference between Elastic Beanstalk and EC2?",

            "question": "Describe a project where you implemented Salesforce solutions.",
            "answer": "In my previous project, I worked on a Salesforce implementation for a mid-sized retail company. I customized the Sales Cloud to streamline their sales process by creating custom objects and fields to track customer interactions. I developed multiple Apex triggers to automate tasks, such as updating the status of leads and sending notifications. Additionally, I built a Lightning Component for a dashboard that displayed real-time sales metrics. The implementation resulted in improved sales tracking and a 25% increase in lead conversion rates."

            "answer": "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods to create, read, update, and delete resources. Each resource is accessed via a unique URL. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data. It offers more flexibility as clients can specify exactly what data they need in a single request, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data."

            "answer": "A RESTful API is an application programming interface that adheres to the principles of REST architecture. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication and is stateless, meaning each request from the client contains all the information needed to process it. Resources are represented by URLs, and data is typically returned in formats like JSON or XML."
